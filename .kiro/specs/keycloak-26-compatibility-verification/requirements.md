# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature verifies and ensures full compatibility of the keycloak-services-social-weixin plugin with Keycloak 26.x versions. The plugin currently declares support for Keycloak 26.1.2, but comprehensive testing is needed to confirm all WeChat login methods work correctly with the latest Keycloak releases, particularly considering the new persistent session mechanism and other architectural changes introduced in version 26.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Setup and Plugin Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to confirm the plugin loads successfully in Keycloak 26.x, so that I can ensure basic compatibility before testing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Keycloak 26.0.6 container is started with the plugin JAR in the providers directory THEN the system SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN Keycloak starts THEN the system SHALL log confirmation that the WeChat identity provider has been loaded
3. IF there are any plugin loading errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in the Keycloak logs
4. WHEN accessing the Keycloak admin console THEN the system SHALL display "微信" as an available identity provider option

### Requirement 2: Configuration Interface Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Keycloak administrator, I want to configure all WeChat authentication methods through the admin interface, so that I can set up different login flows for my users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new WeChat identity provider THEN the system SHALL display all configuration fields including:
   - Standard WeChat app credentials (clientId/clientSecret)
   - WeChat Open Platform credentials (openClientId/openClientSecret)
   - WeChat Mini Program credentials (wmpClientId/wmpClientSecret)
   - WeChat Official Account credentials (clientId2/clientSecret2)
2. WHEN saving the WeChat identity provider configuration THEN the system SHALL persist all settings correctly
3. IF any required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages
4. WHEN editing an existing WeChat identity provider THEN the system SHALL load and display all previously saved configuration values

### Requirement 3: Authentication Flow Functionality

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to log in using any of the supported WeChat authentication methods, so that I can access the application using my preferred WeChat platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from a PC browser AND selecting WeChat login THEN the system SHALL display either:
   - WeChat Open Platform QR code (if openClientEnabled is true)
   - Custom QR code for Official Account (if customizedLoginUrl is configured)
   - Default Official Account QR code (otherwise)
2. WHEN accessing from WeChat browser (user agent contains "micromessenger") THEN the system SHALL redirect to WeChat OAuth2 authorization with scope "snsapi_userinfo"
3. WHEN using WeChat Mini Program login THEN the system SHALL correctly exchange the js_code for session information
4. WHEN scanning Official Account QR code THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user after following the account
5. IF authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or update the user account with WeChat profile information
6. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 4: Session Management Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to work correctly with Keycloak 26's persistent session mechanism, so that user sessions are properly managed across server restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in via WeChat THEN the system SHALL create a persistent session in the database
2. WHEN Keycloak server restarts THEN the system SHALL maintain active WeChat user sessions
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the WeChat identity provider session
4. IF session persistence is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to in-memory session management without errors

### Requirement 5: API and SPI Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all Keycloak APIs and SPIs used by the plugin remain compatible, so that the plugin continues to function without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling the plugin against Keycloak 26.x dependencies THEN the system SHALL compile without deprecation warnings for removed APIs
2. WHEN running unit tests THEN all tests SHALL pass with Keycloak 26.x dependencies
3. IF any Keycloak SPI interfaces have changed THEN the plugin SHALL implement the updated interfaces correctly
4. WHEN using identity broker APIs THEN the system SHALL handle any new required parameters or methods

### Requirement 6: Performance and Stability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the WeChat plugin to maintain performance and stability standards with Keycloak 26.x, so that it doesn't negatively impact the authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing WeChat authentication requests THEN the system SHALL complete authentication within 5 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN handling concurrent authentication requests THEN the system SHALL process them without deadlocks or race conditions
3. IF an external WeChat API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate error handling
4. WHEN monitoring resource usage THEN the plugin SHALL not cause memory leaks or excessive CPU usage

### Requirement 7: Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to upgrade from older Keycloak versions without losing WeChat identity provider configurations, so that existing users can continue to authenticate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading from Keycloak 22.x or 24.x to 26.x THEN the system SHALL preserve existing WeChat identity provider configurations
2. WHEN existing users log in after upgrade THEN the system SHALL correctly link their accounts using the same identifiers (unionId or openId)
3. IF there are breaking changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration documentation
4. WHEN importing realm configurations THEN the system SHALL correctly process WeChat identity provider settings
